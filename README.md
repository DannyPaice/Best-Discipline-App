# Best-Discipline-App

## Overview
The general purpose of this application is to solve people's issues of bad habit
tracking. Most people struggle with staying on track as it's very easy to get
sidetracked to doing other stuff unrelated to their main objectives. Hence
inspired by a "CEO mindset", this app re-orients users to align their goals for
the week to stay on a positive trajectory.

Success for this project would be a functional application which helps users
move the needle consistently and progress.

## Key Features
- Weekly goal setting and tracking
- Simple, quick, intuitive UI
- Emplasis on weekly progress, not perfection
- Weekly feedback and debrief to reinforce consistency

## Project Goals
Success for this project will be defined by:
- A fully functional application with minimal bugs
- A clean, fast, and easy-to-use interface
- Helping users make measurable progress repeatedly

## Project Status
This project is currently under development.
