# Application Specifications

This app must be designed so that it positions the user to stay consistent without punishing them for missing days or inconsistency. As such, instead of correcting user behaviour which could lead to churn, the weekly review concept is designed so that during the week its very low commitment, however the weekly debief re-orients the user so that they still must stay somewhat consistent.

This app needs to encourage progress instead of perfection, hence the other scoring metrics were added.
