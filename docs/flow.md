# Program Flow
This will include the intended flow of the application that is experienced by
the user

## Weekly Debrief (<10 mins)
**Mandatory weekly step which happens on whatever day the user chooses**
1. User answers question ~ 'What kind of week did you have overall?'
    options: light, expected, heavy
2. Application displays scores and metrics
    metrics: total score, sub categories, one sentence summary for the week
3. Guided reflection questions:
    - 'What worked well this week?'
    - 'What got in the way the most often?'
    - 'What would make next week a win?'
    - 'What is one thing you'll do differently next week?'
        a. fewer goals
        b. harder goals
        c. better timing
        d. more recovery
4. Weekly Goals (refer to **first time user** section)

## Daily Flow (<30 seconds)
**Any activity on this day will contribute to the consistency metric**
1. User has the option to choose a maximum of 3 main goals/day from the weekly, or add their own to-do list items that they want
2. As the day goes on, the user can tick the items that they complete
3. At the end of the day, the user can rate how they felt the day went 

## First time user (<1 minute)
**Initial steps the user must do to setup the weekly tasks**
1. User is prompted with what experience level they want (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
2. User adds their 5 main goals they want to complete for the week
3. User rates the difficulty of each goal that they enter
