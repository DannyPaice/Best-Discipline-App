# Scoring system for weekly review

The metric will be divided into 100 pts:
- Follow Through ~ 40pts
- Participation ~ 30pts
- Difficulty Bias ~ 20pts
- Self assessment ~ 10pts

## Calculations
Follow Through = (completed goals / committed goals) * 40

Consistency = (days with activity / 7) * 30

Difficulty = (weighted completed goals / weighted commit goals) * 20
    Easy = 0.8
    Medium = 1
    Challenging = 1.2

Self-assessment:
- self-rating ≈ computed score = 10
- mismatch = partial points

Overall Score = FT + Consistency + Difficulty + Self-assessment
